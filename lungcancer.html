                <h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p>Lung cancer is an abnormal growth of cells in the lungs. Lung cancer may eventually spread to other parts of the body if not discovered 
                    and treated early. The most common factors that can cause lung cancer are exposure to radon, asbestos, air pollution, certain chemicals 
                    in the workplace; smoking or passive smoking; or family history of lung cancer.

                    <h3> Type of Lung Cancer</h3>
                    
                    <p>Lung cancer is of two types:</p>
                    <pre>
        •	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
        •	Small cell lung cancer. 
                         
                    </pre>
                    

                <h3 id="symptoms">
                    SYMPTOMS </h3>
                <pre>
        •	Chest pain
        •	Cough that doesn't go away
        •	Coughing up blood
        •	Fatigue
        •	Loss of appetite
        •	Shortness of breath
        •	Wheezing
                </pre>
                
                <h3 id="causes">CAUSES</h3>
                <P>Lung cancer is considered as the most severe type of cancer for both men and women. 
                    Cigarette smoking is found to be the major cause of lung cancer. Other causes may include:</P>
                <pre>
        •	High levels of air pollution
        •	Family history of lung cancer
        •	Radon gas
        •	Radiation therapy to the lungs
        •	Second hand smoke
        •	Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals
                </pre>
                <h5>Risk Factors:</h5>
                <pre>
        •	Smoking or passive smoking
        •	Exposure to radon, asbestos, air pollution, certain chemicals in the workplace
        •	Family history of lung cancer
                                
                </pre>
                    

                </pre>
                <h3 id="prevention">PREVENTION</h3>
                
                <p>Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent lung cancer.
                    
                     </p>
                <p>The following are risk factors for lung cancer:</p>
                <pre>
        •	Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking
        •	Secondhand smoke
        •	Family history
        •	HIV infection
        •	Environmental risk factors
        •	Beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers
                </pre>
                <p>The following are protective factors for lung cancer:</p>
                <pre>
        •	Not smoking
        •	Quitting smoking
        •	Lower exposure to workplace risk factors
        •	Lower exposure to radon           
                </pre>
                <h3 id="treatment">TREATMENT</h3>
                <pre>
                </pre>
                <h5>Surgery:</h5>
                <P>Diagnostic surgery is done to obtain tissue for pathologic diagnosis of cancer. It includes Tricot Biopsy and incisional or excisional biopsy. 
                    In most cases of initial-stage non-small cell lung cancer, lobectomy (removal of a lobe of lung) is the most preferred surgical option. In rare cases,
                    pneunmonectomy (removal of the entire lung) is done</P>
                <h5>Chemotherapy: </h5>    
                <p>This option is often used when the cancer has spread outside the lungs</p>
                <h5>Radiation therapy:</h5>
                <p>Radiotherapy is often done along with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy involves the use of high energy X Rays that destroy cancer cells and shrink tumors. 
                    About half of all people with cancer are treated with radiation therapy, either alone or in combination with other types of cancer treatment. </p>
            

                <h3 id="whattoeat">WHAT TO EAT</h3>
                <p>Good sources of lean protein include:</p>
                <pre>
        •	Lean meats such as chicken, fish, or turkey
        •	Eggs
        •	Low-fat dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese or dairy substitutes
        •	Nuts and nut butters
        •	Beans
        •	Soy foods                      
                </pre>
                <P>Include whole grains. Whole grains provide a good source of carbohydrate and fiber, which help keep your energy levels up. Good sources of 
                    whole grains include:</P>
                <pre>
        •	Oatmeal
        •	Whole wheat breads
        •	Brown rice
        •	Whole grain pastas
